    <h2>WEEK 05</h2>
    <P>Knowing this would be the last week with C i had an instinct this will not be soo easy, and my prediction didnt prove wrong to.
        I had to watch the last portion twice to grasp things out.And let e reveal a secret I was having a learning slum this week.
        I was idle a bit too.This week took me the longest time to complete.Still know I would say I need  bit more practise
        on all these concepts to make things clearer.
        Nonetheless the whole C journey was just awesome!!! from hello world to data structures.Let me pat myself for this rn.

    <h3>Prboblem sets</h3>
    <p>Who are my parents-I was able to finish it as the other projects(in terms of time and furstation before submitting it),but I wasn't
     finished yet.I wanted to know and understand the recursion process completely and that was the real fun!!I tried asking cs50 "quack" 
     but i failed to understand and was struck wondering for 2 days.Finally,with a bit of extra serached and pen-paper scribbles I could come 
     to a clearer picture.

     Speller-damnnnnnnn,this was lit.I struggled with a single error which always crept in when i tried check50,which was the reason I changed my 
     1st custom logic for hash function,and came up with an even better one.
