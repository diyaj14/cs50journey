        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        Imagine of a kid who has just completed 12th grade and is trying to find the best thing to learn.Tht's how I ended up in cs50.
        My aim at the beginning was to do cs50 AI course but this was it's prerequiste.So yah I decided to dive into these courses and here 
        I am taking the first step with the hope of a thrilling experince throughout the journey.

        First week of cs50 was basically me feeling insecure, trying to grab in more information of how COOL the course is and
        reassuring myself that I will be consistent till the end of the course.

        I tried grasping a bit about Git and Github too from youtube,as I heard from reddit that this course uses github account for
        submissions.
        <h3>The Meow week</h3>
        <p>"An engaging and awesome lecture",-that was my first impression of David.J.Malan's classes. As someone who had a faint memory of the "scratch cat",
            when our teacher showed how to make it move during high school(in the school digitaly),I was interested to create my own scratch game will be my 1st as the first project
            for cs50.I enjoyed every bit of it.
            
            The 2 hours went by in a flash and I completed the lecture in one-sitting.The classes felt so live even after sitting at a remote location,I wonder how good it would be for those people who see
            his live classes.

            The amount of quality material they provide is again too good to be true.The cs50 ai(QUACK!),the lecture notes and much more...
        <h3>Scratch Cat</h3>
            </p>It was fun to do drag-and-drop coding.
               "Dark matter" as I titled it was based on a science fiction book(I love reading books)which I read a few days before starting cs50.
                This is my project.
