        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        First week of cs50 was basically me feeling insecure, trying to grab in more information of how COOL the course is and
        reassuring myself i will be consistent till the end of the course.
        <h3>The Meow week</h3>
        <p>"An engaging lecture",-that was my first imression of David.J.Malan's classes! As someone who had a faint memory of scratch cat,
            when our teacher showed it move during high school(in the school digitaly).I never knew that a scratch game will be my 1st project 
            on cs50.From seeing the professor's scratch project,to seeing the cat meow was just so cool.
            The 2 hours went by in a flash and I completed the lecture in one-sitting.The classes felt so live even after sitting at a remote location,still can't even think of how good it would be for those people who actually
            get to be a part of this course.
            The amount of quality material they provide is again just too good to even believe.The cs50 ai(QUACK!),the lecture notes and much more...
            <h4>My project</h4>
            </p>It was fun to do drag-and-drop coding.
               "Dark matter" as I titled it was based on a book which I read a few days before starting cs50.
               this being my project
