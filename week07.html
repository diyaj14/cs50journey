    <h3>The Databases Week</h3>
    <p>It felt easy to cover the basics of SQL with a prior basic knowledge,but the nested queries where mind bending.sqlite was something new for me.
        I skimmed through nearly half of the video,as I was already familiar with quite a bit of SQL stuff.The other half satisfied my craving for 
        new learnings.The creation of indexes,the sql injection attacks and race conditions and of course nested queries made my knowedge level take another
        leap.

    <h3>Songs and Movies</h3>
    <p>This was a pretty easy problem set,which was less challenging and quite basic.Yet it felt good to refresh my memory again.
        The last few questions of movies though,did standout. I had to ask my mate "cs50 quack" to find a way out.To be honest, I sometimes
        have the instinct to punch this duck because of the momentry thought,"Why can't you just give the direct answer!",later when sanity sets 
        in "This is cs50,and you are here to learn things yourself girl!".
