            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>"Learning a new programming language"-(My 1st thought I can now put in my resume that I know C).C thus became 2nd language 
                I was going to learn </p>
            <h3>The "BEGIN-REAL-CODING" week</h3> 
            <p>
               After having fun with scratch,It was time to make loops and conditionals in C.This week went from printing the classic "hello world"
               to learning about data types,loops and conditionals.It was cool watching the professor convert each scratch puzzle pieces to actual C .
               
            <h3>Mario</h3>
            <p>As a kid,who learnt to make patterns in class 12,using python I thought it would be easy.To an extend that knowledge helped I would say.
                But it required a logic which required a bit of background work.
            <h3>Cash</h3>   
            That was a pretty easy one I would say,based on the logic you should apply,but me being me made a lot of silly errors and  had to compile it
            a few more times than expected.
            (Being someone from another country I had to process my mind on what these cents,nickels etc.. actually is)
            </p>
            <p>Overall,week 1 was not tooooo hard to follow,and i quite enjoyed the problem sets</p>
