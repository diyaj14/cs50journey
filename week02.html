    <h3>The Bug week</h3>
    <p>I was confused at first as I wasnt able to understand the fuss about reading levels which was said at the beginning.
        The week provided a whole new insight to the compiling process.
        Quack!Quack!Quack! make way to debug50,the new cs50 helper.. cs50 opened my eyes to the different ways of how you can debug..
        It took time for to adjust with arrays of C,especially since I couldnt find a way to make arrays dynamic.</p>
    <p>The readability did make me uneasy for quite amount of time,me having no idea how to calculate average letters and sentences per humdred words
        and later to realise it could be done with a simple logic after hours of toil.
        Caesar felt relativly easy to crack than Readbility(a contradictory opnion).
