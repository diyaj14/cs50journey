        <H2>week 04</H2>
        <p>As I mentioned in week 03,I wasn't having much fun with the problem sets and was in dilemma of weather to do tidemann or not.
            I finally arrived at this decision to do the c part completely(without doing the challenging optional sets) and then come back again to those.
            Hope that works out!

            As I started off with week 04,
            I realised THIS LECTURE IS GIVING IN A LOT OF NEW AND COMPLICATED INFO THAN previous ones!so i decided to read the cs50 lecture notes and rewatch all those portions that i couldnt grasp,AGAIN.
            With a bit of extra time,i gained an overall idea and started off with the project.
            <h3>Volume</h3>
            <p>It took me time to understand what all is going on,but then the coding part was not that hard</p>
            <h4>Filter</h4>
            <p>Filter was lit!I had fun doing the filter-less itself,It felt like a challenge which had to be tackled bit-by-bit.
                The grayscale rounding part felt fishy and I still blame C for that(No offense).The problem gave me mixed vibes,each time i used check50.
                Happiness when a part of problem was solved,followed by realisation that there's still tonnes yet to be solved..But it was enjoyable and irritable.
                The sepia filter was giving in blue color which made me a bit mad,but yet cs50 ai came for the rescue,we solved it together!.The blur was the best 
                part!!! It was incredible to think of logic, which took me hours.The happiness that I felt after solving it was just beyond bounds.
            <h4>Recover</h4>
            <p>
                This was a problem set which i wrote the code in few hours but which took me days to debug.It was the first time tbh i used debug50(it may sound
                wierd).I tried using malloc for some reason,which i gave up during my debugging process.
            </p>
        <p>Overall week 4 was the most challenging one yet.</p>
