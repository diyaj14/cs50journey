    <h2>WEEK 06</h2>
    <P>As a person who learnt python in my 11th and 12th,this I would say was the easiest lecture to watch.My classmates(friends) were planning for conducting 
        a hackathon of creating a chatbot that could play logic games(tic-tac-toe) using python,so this week paved me oppurtunity to refresh my memory
        and also to get something extra embeded in it.
    </P>
    <p>problem sets</p>
    <p>I tried only the harder ones this time as I was comfortable with this language.
        The mario-more turned out to be easier than I thought,but I had to struggle a bit with credit.My misunderstanding of Luhn's algorithm
        and incorrect usage of brackets becoming the main thieves of time.
