    <h2>WEEK 06</h2>
    <P>As a person who learnt python in my 11th and 12th,this I would say was the easiest lecture to watch.My classmates(friends) were planning for conducting 
        a hackathon of creating a chatbot that could play logic games(tic-tac-toe) using python,so this week paved me oppurtunity to refresh my memory
        and also to get something extra embeded in it.
    </P>
    <p>problem sets</p>
    <p>I tried only the harder ones this time as I was comfortable with this language.
        The mario-more turned out to be easier than I thought,but I had to struggle a bit with credit.My misunderstanding of Luhn's algorithm
        and incorrect usage of brackets becoming the main thieves of time.Readability was a piece of cake this time,converting C code to python 
        was one of the easiest problems lately.
        But DNA was standing reading as a cooler challenge.The print function,was my life saver while solving this problem.I took a bit time
        trying to understand the "biological logic" behind the stuff.
        The most coolest thing about all the problem sets so far is that it takes in in real world problems,which is rarely seen in schools.
